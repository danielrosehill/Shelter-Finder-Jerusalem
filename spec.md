The GeoJSON file here is a list of the emergency shelters in Jerusalem which are divided across a number of categories. I'd like to create an Android app which will do the following. Firstly the user should be able to retrieve their light position using the phone's location services. Then the main function of the app would be twofold. Firstly to show the nearby shelters on a map with different icons according to the type of shelter. Secondly, when the user hits a button, find shelter, it should jump to a list of the 10 nearest shelters by distances of crow flies, for each listing the computed distance. and then for each there's a button showing the category and then for each there's a button that says take me to shelter which will jump to a Google Maps where their starting point is their current location and their destination as the location of the shelter and provides and then they can use that for directions other than that it should just have zoom in zoom out Listing the shelters and finding them. That's the purpose of the app.
